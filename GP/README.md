# Mapping the 1% top income around the world using Gaussian Processes
Using <a href = https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/gaussian_process.html>scikit-learn's Gaussian process</a> implementation to map 1% income shares around the world and predict for the countries without data.

Assuming income distributions are a geographical effect is a <b>terrible</b> first order approximation. Income distributions are not (excluding regional politics) a product of geographic location, but more a relic of cultural and political standpoints, which largely remain within borders.
